        <h1>The art of Ukiyo-e</h1>
        <p>Ukiyo-e[a] is a genre of Japanese art which flourished from the 17th through 19th centuries. Its artists produced woodblock prints and paintings of such subjects as female beauties; kabuki actors and sumo wrestlers; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes and landscapes; flora and fauna; and erotica. The term ukiyo-e (浮世絵) translates as 'picture[s] of the floating world'.</p>

        <h1>Utagawa Kuniyoshi</h1>
        <p>Utagawa Kuniyoshi (Japanese: 歌川 国芳); (January 1, 1798[1] - April 14, 1861) was one of the last great masters of the Japanese ukiyo-e style of woodblock prints and painting. He was a member of the Utagawa school.
          The range of Kuniyoshi's subjects included many genres: landscapes, beautiful women, Kabuki actors, cats, and mythical animals.
           He is known for depictions of the battles of legendary samurai heroes. His artwork incorporated aspects of Western representation 
           in landscape painting and caricature.</p>

        <h1>Artists Life</h1>
        <p> Kuniyoshi was born on January 1, 1798, the son of a silk-dyer, Yanagiya Kichiyemon originally named Yoshisaburō. Yoshisaburō proved his drawing talents at age 12, quickly attracting the attention of the famous ukiyo-e print master Utagawa Toyokuni. He was officially admitted to Toyokuni's studio in 1811, and became one of his chief pupils. He remained an apprentice until 1814, at which time he was given the name "Kuniyoshi" and set out as an independent artist. During this year he produced his first published work. Between 1815 and 1817 he created a number of book illustrations,and printed his stand-alone full color prints of "kabuki" actors and warriors. During the 1820s, Kuniyoshi produced a number of heroic triptychs that show the first signs of an individual style.  In 1827 he received his first major commission for the Suikoden series. The series became extremely popular in Edo, and the demand for Kuniyoshi's warrior prints increased, gaining him entrance into the major ukiyo-e and literary circles.
          The Tenpō Reforms of 1841-1843 aimed to alleviate economic crisis by controlling public displays of luxury. Paintings of actors were also banned. Kuniyoshi painted caricatures of famous actors evading the law. He also painted landscape art at this time. In the late 1840s, Kuniyoshi began again to illustrate actor prints, this time evading censorship (or simply evoking creativity) through childish, cartoon-like portraits. In 1856 Kuniyoshi suffered from palsy, which caused him much difficulty in moving his limbs. It is said that his works from this point onward were noticeably weaker in the use of line and overall vitality. Before his death in 1861, Kuniyoshi was able to witness the opening of the port city of Yokohama to foreigners, and in 1860 produced two works depicting Westerners in the city (Yokohama-e, ex. View of Honchō and The pleasure quarters, Yokohama). He died at the age of 63 in April 1861 in his home in Genyadana.

        <h1>Katsushika Hokusai</h1>
        <p>Katsushika Hokusai (葛飾 北斎, c. 31 October 1760 - 10 May 1849), known simply as Hokusai, was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist of the Edo period, active as a painter and printmaker. He is best known for the woodblock print series Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji, which includes the iconic print The Great Wave off Kanagawa. Hokusai was instrumental in developing ukiyo-e from a style of portraiture largely focused on courtesans and actors into a much broader style of art that focused on landscapes, plants, and animals. His works are thought to have had a significant influence on Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet during the wave of Japonisme, that spread across Europe in the late 19th century.
          Hokusai created the monumental Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji as a response to a domestic travel boom in Japan and as part of a personal interest in Mount Fuji. It was this series, specifically, The Great Wave off Kanagawa and Fine Wind, Clear Morning, that secured his fame both in Japan and overseas.
          Hokusai was best known for his woodblock ukiyo-e prints, but he worked in a variety of mediums including painting and book illustration.</p>
